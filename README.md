# ETLExample
A program that demonstrates extracting, transforming, and loading data from Microsoft Excel through Python. Running 'main.py' will run 'extractTransformLoad.py' that will read the five Excel files in the directory, conduct merges and format changes, and output 'Customer Order Payment Summary.xlsx'. Following that file, 'kpiExport.py' will load the customer report and generate a 'KPI Summary.xlsx' file that provides an aging report and a KPI summary. Pictures of the output are provided below:
